## ðŸš€ New Release: MIDI Protocol Support!
## Introduction
PENDA Software is an advanced framework tailored for the **PENDA Hardware** platform [GitHub Link](https://github.com/DADDesign-Projects/PENDA-Hardware), enabling effortless development of high-quality audio effect pedals. Designed to streamline development, it allows creators to focus entirely on signal processing while the framework manages hardware complexities.

## Author
This project is developed by DAD Design.

## Key Features
- **Full Integration**: Seamlessly works with **PENDA Hardware** and **DAISY Seed**.
- **Optimized Audio Processing**: Built-in support for **Audio CODEC**, handling initialization and real-time processing.
- **Memory Management**:
  - **SDRAM** for efficient data storage.
  - **QSPI Flash** for fast, non-volatile storage, including file persistence and flashing utilities.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:
  - **TFT Display** with **ST7789** driver support.
  - **DaisySeedGFX2** for advanced UI visualization and customization.
  - Interactive controls via **footswitches** (tap tempo), **encoders** and **MIDI protocol**.
- **Development Environment**: Built with **STM32Cube**, offering modular and extensible architecture for easy customization.

With **PENDA Hardware**, this framework provides an all-in-one solution for pedal effect development, eliminating the need for low-level hardware management.
